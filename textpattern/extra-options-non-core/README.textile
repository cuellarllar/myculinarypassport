h1. Extra code options

These snippets of code are purely optional and allow you to extend the functionality of the original theme.

h2. Extra code option: analytics

h4. /extra-options-non-core/analytics/analytics.misc.txp

Add "Google Analytics":http://www.google.com/analytics/ tracking to your pages. You can either paste the contents of this form directly into the bottom your page templates (just before the @</body>@ tag) or put a @<txp:output_form form="analytics" />@ tag in the bottom of the your page templates instead, create a new form in the system with name of 'analytics' and type of 'misc', then copy/paste the code from this form into it. Add your unique Google Analytics ID into the code where indicated.

h2. Extra code option: code_prettify

Google provides scripting to turn code within @<pre>@ tags into colour coded markup. It is recommended that you read the documentation before installation, which is available on the "Google Code Prettify project page":http://google-code-prettify.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/README.html. *Note:* requires Textile v2.3.2 or later.

Todo.

Here are three ways of activating the script... either via an @onload@ in the @<body>@ tag, for example:

bc. <body onload="prettyPrint()">

Via jQuery (if available), for example:

bc. jQuery(function () {
  window.prettyPrint && prettyPrint();
});

Once all required CSS and JavaScript files are in place, the code markup styling can be invoked via HTML or Textile (as of Textile v2.3.2 onwards).

To invoke via HTML without line numbers:

bc. <pre class="prettyprint"><code> ... </code></pre>

To invoke via HTML without line numbers:

bc. <pre class="prettyprint linenums"><code> ... </code></pre>

To invoke via Textile without line numbers:

bc. bc(prettyprint).

To invoke via Textile with line numbers:

bc. bc(prettyprint linenums).

h2. Extra code option: cookie_disclaimer

Todo.

The "EU cookie law":http://www.cookielaw.org/the-cookie-law-explained.aspx came into effect in Europe (excluding UK) on May 26th 2011 and was adopted in the UK a year later on May 26th 2012. The law requires website owners to make their users aware of cookie use on a website, this takes the form of a disclaimer clearly displayed upon the first visit to your website. If you implement cookies within your site (including use of Google Analytics software) then you must comply with the law and show a clear disclaimer - the module provided here gives that functionality.

h4. /extra-options-non-core/cookie_disclaimer/cookie_disclaimer.scss

Todo.

h4. /extra-options-non-core/cookie_disclaimer/cookie_disclaimer.txp

You can either paste the contents of this form directly into the bottom your page templates (just before the @</body>@ tag) or put a @<txp:output_form form="cookie_disclaimer" />@ tag in the bottom of the your page templates instead, create a new form in the system with name of 'cookie_disclaimer' and type of 'misc', then copy/paste the code from this form into it. You must also have "jQuery":https://github.com/philwareham/txp-h5bp-theme/tree/master/extra-options-non-core#extra-code-option-jquery available and linked. Add this code *after* the jQuery link in your page (not necessary if you use yepnope).

h2. Extra code option: flickr

h4. /extra-options-non-core/flickr/flickr.scss

Todo.

h4. /extra-options-non-core/flickr/flickr.txp

Either paste this file into page templates before the end of the @role="complementary"@ sidebar. Or put a @<txp:output_form form="flickr" />@ tag in your page templates @role="complementary"@ sidebar instead, create a new form in the system with name of 'flickr' and type of 'misc', then copy/paste the code from this form into it.

Remember to change the text @your_flickr_badge_id@ to your actual "Flickr ID":http://www.adamwlewis.com/articles/what-is-my-flickr-id and @your_flickr_url@ to your actual Flickr URL.

h2. Extra code option: footer_copyright

h4. /extra-options-non-core/footer_copyright/footer.txp

Add dynamically updated copyright statement to your page footers. Paste the code into your current page templates, replacing the previous footer code. Note this code requires that you have 'Allow PHP in pages?' set to 'yes' in the Textpattern advanced preferences.

h4. /extra-options-non-core/footer_copyright/footer-roman.txp

Same as @footer.txp@ above, but displaying roman numerals for the year instead - BBC style. Otherwise, installation instructions apply as for above.

h2. Extra code option: google_plus

h4. /extra-options-non-core/google_plus/google_plus1.txp

Add a Google '+1' button to each of your articles. Paste the code from that form into your default.article.txp form (around line 25 is recommended).

h2. Extra code option: jquery

h4. /extra-options-non-core/jquery/jquery.txp

You can either paste the contents of this form directly into your page templates or put a @<txp:output_form form="jquery" />@ tag in your page templates instead, create a new form in the system with name of 'jquery' and type of 'misc', then copy/paste the code from this form into it. Note that preferred link is via Google's CDN hosted copy of jQuery, with a fallback to the locally hosted copy if the CDN is unavailable.

bc. <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="<txp:site_url />js/libs/jquery.js"><\/script>')</script>

The advantages of using the CDN version over your own hosted copy is threefold - one, it saves bandwidth on your own server; two, Google's servers are extremely low latency and high bandwidth; three, there is a fair chance an end user will already have a copy of Google's CDN jQuery already cached in their browser if they have been to another site that has also used this method to provide jQuery, that means they will not have to reload it and ultimately makes your site render quicker - bonus points!

h2. Extra code option: meta_open_graph

h4. /extra-options-non-core/meta_open_graph/meta_open_graph.txp

Meta tags for the "Open Graph protocol":http://ogp.me, primarily for Facebook functionality but can also be used independently of any Facebook widgets (although only Facebook seem to use this protocol in any meaningful way).

h2. Extra code option: old_browser

h4. /extra-options-non-core/chrome_frame/old_browser.misc.txp

Add the option for politely informing any users of Internet Explorer < 8 that they could should update to a modern browser. You can either paste the contents of this form directly into your page templates (just after @<div class="container">@ is recommended) or put a @<txp:output_form form="chrome_frame" />@ tag in your page templates instead (again, just after @<div class="container">@ is recommended), create a new form in the system with name of 'chrome_frame' and type of 'misc', then copy/paste the code from this form into it.

h4. /extra-options-non-core/code_prettify/old_browser.scss

Todo.

h2. Extra code option: page_title

h4. /extra-options-non-core/page_title/page_title.misc.txp

Use this form in your site to provide more context focused page titles, it sets up a variable to check what section you are in and provide specific title content. Based on an example by Els Lepelaars. Create a new form in the system with name of 'page_title' and type of 'misc', then copy/paste the code from this file into it. This form can then be called from your page/form templates by inserting @<txp:output_form form="page_title" />@ into the @<head>@ section.

h2. Extra code option: responsiveslides

A responsive image slideshow (slider) jQuery plugin. See the "responsiveslider.js website":http://responsive-slides.viljamis.com/ for more information regarding this plugin.

h4. /extra-options-non-core/responsiveslides/slides.txp

Place this code into your page template at the desired location for your slider (or create a new form in the system with name of 'slides' and type of 'misc', and then output that form at the desired location). Then import a group of images into your Textpattern system and give them all matching category label (the default category is 'slides' - feel free to change it whatever suits your needs, but remember to also change the category in this code too).

If you only want to display your slider on the homepage of your website then wrap it in @<txp:if_section />@ tags like so:

bc. <txp:if_section name="">
  <txp:output_form form="slider" />
</txp:if_section>

h4. /extra-options-non-core/responsiveslides/responsiveslides.scss

Todo.

h4. /extra-options-non-core/responsiveslides/responsiveslides.txp

You can either paste the contents of this form directly into the bottom your page templates (just before the @</body>@ tag) or put a @<txp:output_form form="responsiveslides" />@ tag in the bottom of the your page templates instead, create a new form in the system with name of 'responsiveslides' and type of 'misc', then copy/paste the code from this form into it. You must also have "jQuery":https://github.com/philwareham/txp-h5bp-theme/tree/master/extra-options-non-core#extra-code-option-jquery available and linked. Add this code *after* the jQuery link in your page (not necessary if you use yepnope).

h2. Extra code option: twitter

h4. /extra-options-non-core/twitter/twitter_tweet.txp
